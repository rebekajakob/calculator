# A little calculator programmed in React. 
## It only knows 2 operation (addition and subtraction), because my main focus was to try new things in React (varied buttons) and it was the first time for me to use Tailwind (I used Bootstrap before).
## The root map contains a Spring Boot section as weel because in the beggining I wanted a backend server as well. During the development I was too occupied with the frontend side, but in the future maybe I will add some extra functions to my little calculator, where a backend server would be useful.
### Hint: You can try it if you go to the frontend folder and run npm install and then npm start.
